# Git workflow
## Git?
- a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel 
- an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System)
- every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository containing the full history of all changes

## Workflow?
>A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information.

## Git Workflow?
>A Git Workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. 


### Centralized Workflow
- transitioning from SVN
- a central repository as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project

### Feature branching
- a logical extension of Centralized Workflow
- all feature development taking place in a dedicated branch 
- easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase
- master branch always containing production-quality code

### Gitflow Workflow
- a strict branching model designed around the project release
- not new concepts or commands beyond whatâ€™s required for the Feature Branch Workflow
- assigning specific roles to different branches and defining how and when they should interact

### Forking Workflow
- every developer having a server-side repository means each contributor having two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one
